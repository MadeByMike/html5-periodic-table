Periodic table of HTML 5 elements
=================================

Full credit to Josh Duck for origionally creating the HTML 5 periodic table of elements. 

I'm not sure why Josh removed his version from his website. I think it was useful so this is my recreation of it.

This version is made with css only, so modern browsers please.
